# Palila2HTML
This library generates an HTML/CSS/Javascript project from your Palila web framwork project.

Ordinarily, if you want to have a frontend in Palila, you would want to develop it as an HTMl/CSS/Javascript project, then have it imported using HTML2J so that it can be rendered using J2HTML. However, what happens when you lose your original HTML/CSS/Javascript project? Have it extracted out of your Palila project!
